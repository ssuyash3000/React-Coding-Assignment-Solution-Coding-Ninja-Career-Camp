Expense Tracker - II

Now that you have changed the class components to functional components, the team has asked you to implement the feature to add and remove a transaction.
After adding or deleting a transaction, the balance, income, and expenses should be updated.
A user should not be able to add a transaction with a value of 0.
Income is the sum of all transactions with values greater than 0.
Expense is the sum of all transactions with values less than 0.
Note - Use the current Date as the id for the expense. {id: new Date().getTime()}
