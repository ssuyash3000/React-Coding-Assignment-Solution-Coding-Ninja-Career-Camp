### You have created an online course-buying platform called CodeTube Catalog, where you can buy courses and follow/unfollow your favorite instructors.

You realize that the “follow/unfollow” and “add to bag” buttons are similar.
The course list and instructor list styles are also similar.

So, you decide to create reusable components called Button and Container using styled components.

The Button component should have a “bg” property which sets the background color and the Container should have a flex property which sets the flex value.

Justification - TestCases will fail if the props do not have the exact same name

You have also built individual components like Course, Sidebar, etc.
When you add/remove a course from the bag, the count of courses in the bag doesn’t get updated.

Find a way to fix this issue without changing the output.
